# Print the pattern | Set-1

You a given a number N. You need to print the pattern for the given value of N.
for N = 2 the pattern will be 
2 2 1 1
2 1
for N = 3 the pattern will be 
3 3 3 2 2 2 1 1 1
3 3 2 2 1 1
3 2 1

<b>Example 1:</b>
~~~~
Input: 2
Output:
2 2 1 1 $2 1 $
~~~~

<b>Example 2:</b>
~~~~
Input: 3
Output:
3 3 3 2 2 2 1 1 1 $3 3 2 2 1 1 $3 2 1 $
~~~~

<b>Your Task:</b>
Since this is a function problem, you don't need to worry about the testcases. Your task is to complete the function printPat which takes one argument 'N' denoting the length of the pattern.
Note : Instead of printing new line print a "$" without quotes.

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 40

Note:The Input/Ouput format and Example given are used for system's internal purpose, and should be used by a user for Expected Output only. As it is a function problem, hence a user should not read any input from stdin/console. The task is to complete the function specified, and not to write the full code.
